# Certainly! Let's explore directories and symbolic links in **Linux Mint**:

## 1. **Directories (Folders)**:
   - Directories are like containers that organize files. They hold files and other directories.
   - When you navigate through your file system, you're moving between directories.
   - Common terminal commands related to directories:
     - `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current working directory³.
     - `cd`: Changes the current directory (e.g., `cd Documents`).

## 2. **Symbolic Links (Symlinks)**:
   - Symlinks are advanced shortcuts.
   - A symlink points to another file or directory, even though it appears as if it's the actual file.
   - To create a symlink using the `ln` command:
     ```
     ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link
     ```
   - For example, creating a symlink from your Downloads folder to your Desktop:
     ```
     ln -s /home/username/Downloads /home/username/Desktop
     ```
