# string searching using grep in Linux

## 1. Basic Usage:
   The fundamental syntax of grep is:
   ```
   grep [options] pattern [file...]
   ```
   
   Example:
   ```
   grep "error" logfile.txt
   ```
   This searches for the word "error" in logfile.txt.

## 2. Case Sensitivity:
   - By default, grep is case-sensitive.
   - Use -i for case-insensitive search:
     ```
     grep -i "error" logfile.txt
     ```

## 3. Regular Expressions:
   grep supports regular expressions for powerful pattern matching.
   
   - . (dot): Matches any single character
   - *: Matches zero or more of the preceding character
   - ^: Matches the start of a line
   - $: Matches the end of a line
   - []: Matches any single character in brackets
   
   Example:
   ```
   grep "^Error" logfile.txt  # Lines starting with "Error"
   grep "failed$" logfile.txt  # Lines ending with "failed"
   grep "t[ae]st" logfile.txt  # Matches "test" or "tast"
   ```

## 4. Extended Regular Expressions:
   Use -E option or egrep command for extended regex:
   ```
   grep -E "Error|Warning" logfile.txt
   egrep "Error|Warning" logfile.txt
   ```

## 5. Inverting the Match:
   -v option inverts the match, showing lines that don't match:
   ```
   grep -v "success" logfile.txt
   ```

## 6. Displaying Line Numbers:
   -n option shows line numbers:
   ```
   grep -n "error" logfile.txt
   ```

## 7. Counting Matches:
   -c option counts the number of matching lines:
   ```
   grep -c "error" logfile.txt
   ```

## 8. Showing Context:
   - -A n: Shows n lines after the match
   - -B n: Shows n lines before the match
   - -C n: Shows n lines before and after the match
   
   Example:
   ```
   grep -C 2 "critical error" logfile.txt
   ```

## 9. Recursive Search:
   -r option searches recursively through directories:
   ```
   grep -r "TODO" /path/to/project
   ```

## 10. Matching Whole Words:
    -w option matches whole words only:
    ```
    grep -w "log" logfile.txt
    ```

## 11. Displaying Filename:
    - -H: Always print filename
    - -h: Never print filename
    ```
    grep -H "error" *.log
    ```

## 12. Quiet Mode:
    -q option suppresses output, useful in scripts:
    ```
    if grep -q "error" logfile.txt; then
        echo "Errors found"
    fi
    ```

## 13. Using grep with Pipes:
   grep works well with pipes for filtering output:
   ```
   ps aux | grep "nginx"
   ```

## 14. Multiple Patterns:
    Use -e option for multiple patterns:
    ```
    grep -e "error" -e "warning" -e "critical" logfile.txt
    ```

## 15. Reading Patterns from a File:
    -f option reads patterns from a file:
    ```
    grep -f patterns.txt logfile.txt
    ```

## 16. Binary Files:
    - -a: Process binary files as text
    - --binary-files=without-match: Assume binary files don't match
    
    ```
    grep -a "string" binary_file
    ```

## 17. Colorizing Output:
    --color option highlights matches:
    ```
    grep --color "error" logfile.txt
    ```

## 18. Excluding Files:
    --exclude option excludes files from the search:
    ```
    grep "TODO" --exclude="*.o" -r .
    ```

## 19. Including Only Certain Files:
    --include option includes only specified files:
    ```
    grep "function" --include="*.c" -r .
    ```

## 20. Null-Separated Output:
    -Z option outputs a zero byte after filename:
    ```
    grep -lZ "error" *.log | xargs -0 rm
    ```
