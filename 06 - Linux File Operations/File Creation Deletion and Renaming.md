# File Deletion and Renaming in Linux.

## 1. **Creating a File**:
   - To create a new file, use the `touch` command followed by the desired filename:
     ```
     touch sample.txt
     ```

## 2. **Copying Files**:
   - The `cp` command copies a file. For example:
     ```
     cp file.txt new-file.txt
     ```

## 3. **Moving or Renaming Files**:
   - The `mv` command moves files from one location to another. It's also used for renaming files:
     ```
     mv old-file.txt new-file.txt
     ```

## 4. **Removing Files**:
   - To delete a file, use the `rm` command:
     ```
     rm unwanted-file.txt
     ```
