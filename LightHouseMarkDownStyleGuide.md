**Markdown Style Guide**
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here's a simple guide:
- Headers: Use # for headers. The number of # indicates the level of the header. For example, # Header 1, ## Header 2, ### Header 3.
- Emphasis: Use * for emphasis. For example, *italic* or **bold**.
- Lists: Use - for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists. For example:

- Item 1
- Item 2

or

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

- Links: Use [link text](url) to create a hyperlink. For example, [Bing](https://www.bing.com).
- Images: Use ![alt text](url) to insert an image. For example, ![Bing Logo](https://www.bing.com/logo.png).
- Code: Use backticks (`) to denote code. Use single backticks for inline code and triple backticks for blocks of code.
-   `{InLine Code}`

- Blocks of Code
```JavaScript
var foo = bar:
```

- Tables: Use | to create tables. For example:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |

- Blockquotes: Use > for blockquotes. For example, 
> This is a quote.
- Horizontal Rule: Use --- or *** to create a horizontal rule. Example:
---
- Strikethrough: Use ~~ for strikethrough. For example, ~~strikethrough~~.

Remember, the goal of using Markdown is to make documents more readable. Keep it simple and consistent.

## Example Document: A Brief Blog Post about Linux File Structures

# Understanding Linux File Structures

Linux file structure is a tree-like hierarchy, making it organized and manageable. Let's delve into it.

## Root Directory

The root directory, denoted as `/`, is the starting point of the file system hierarchy.

## Home Directory

Located at `/home`, this directory contains user directories, with each user having a unique directory.

## Etc Directory

The `/etc` directory contains system-wide configuration files.

## Bin and Sbin Directories

`/bin` and `/sbin` hold essential system binaries and system binaries for the root user, respectively.

## Var Directory

`/var` is for variable data files such as logs and databases.

## Conclusion

Understanding the Linux file structure is crucial for system navigation and management. Happy exploring!
