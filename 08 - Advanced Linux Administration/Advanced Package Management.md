# Advanced Package Management

## 1. **APT (Advanced Packaging Tool)**:
   - APT is the primary package manager for Debian-based systems, including Linux Mint.
   - It handles software installation, removal, querying, and upgrades.
   - Common APT commands:
     - `sudo apt update`: Refreshes package lists from repositories.
     - `sudo apt install package-name`: Installs a package.
     - `sudo apt remove package-name`: Removes a package.
     - `sudo apt upgrade`: Upgrades installed packages.
     - `sudo apt search keyword`: Searches for packages.
   - APT uses `.deb` packages and works alongside `dpkg`, which installs individual `.deb` files.

## 2. **Synaptic Package Manager**:
   - Synaptic is an advanced graphical package management tool.
   - To install Synaptic:
     ```
     sudo apt install synaptic 
     ```
   - Launch it from the Applications menu or by typing `synaptic` in the terminal.
