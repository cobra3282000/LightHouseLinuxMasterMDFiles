# File and Directory Managment

1. **List Files (ls):** The `ls` command lists files in the current directory. By default, it displays files in the current folder. For example:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```

2. **Change Directory (cd):** Use `cd` to navigate between directories:
    - To move up one level (e.g., from `/home/user/docs` to `/home/user`), use `cd ..`.
    - To go directly to a specific directory (e.g., `/home/user/music`), provide the absolute path: `cd /home/user/music`.
    - To return home from any location, use `cd ~`.

3. **Create Directories (mkdir):** You can create directories using `mkdir`. For example:
    - Create a directory named "dir1":
        ```bash
        mkdir dir1
        ```
    - Create nested directories (with `-p` flag):
        ```bash
        mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3
        ```

4. **Remove Files (rm):** The `rm` command deletes files. For example:
    ```bash
    rm testfile
    ```

5. **Remove Directories (rmdir and rm -rf):**
    - Use `rmdir` to remove empty directories:
        ```bash
        rmdir dir1
        ```
    - Use `rm -rf` with caution to forcefully remove a directory and its contents:
        ```bash
        rm -rf dir1
        ```
