# Using the Terminal

1. **Opening the Terminal**:
   - You can open the terminal in various ways:
     - **Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
     - **Specific Directory**: Open the terminal in a specific directory.
     - **Application Menu**: Search for "Terminal" in your applications.
     - **Command**: Use the `gnome-terminal` command.

2. **Basic Commands**:
   - Once you're in the terminal, try these commands:
     - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
     - `ls`: List files and directories.
     - `cd`: Change directory.
     - `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
     - `cp`: Copy files or directories.
     - `mv`: Move files or rename them.
     - `rm`: Remove files or directories.
     - `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.
