# Project Title: Lighthouse MVP

## Overview
Team built Hugo Blog site. 

## Background Context
Because the lighthouse project is faltering on the CMS front and has taken an extreme amount of time to get anything even a super simple amount of time, I am instituting a simple GitHub static page with the contents from roadmap.sh. 

## Opportunity Statement
Roadmap.sh was the initial tool to get the MVP content we needed for the lighthouse project copy on the main site. The roadmap is not very helpful despite its design. We keep having the issue where the content is not saved. It is also not sustainable to add more contributors. And in the end is not the goal for the lighthouse project. In hindsight it would have been a good tool if roadmap had worked as advertised and we had time to focus on it. 
Going forward I am going to invest the time to get everyone on board creating content via a GitHub repo and static blog site.
